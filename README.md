# Caterpillar_Game
This project is a Java-based implementation of a caterpillar game designed as an assignment to practice data structures and their applications. The game involves a caterpillar moving around a 2D map, eating food to grow bigger. It is developed across three parts: implementing basic data structures (lists, stacks, queues), parsing information using stacks, and the game logic involving movement, eating, and avoiding collisions. The game progresses by decoding actions and food positions, guiding the caterpillar to grow by consuming food without colliding with itself or walls, aiming to clear the map of food.
To start the game, locate the CaterpillarGame.java file within the project structure and run it. The game interface will prompt players with instructions on controlling the caterpillar, typically using keyboard inputs for navigation. Players aim to guide the caterpillar to consume food on the map, avoiding obstacles and the caterpillar's own growing body to progress through levels or achieve a high score.
